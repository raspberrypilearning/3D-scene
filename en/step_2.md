## Get inspiration

You are going to create a '3D scene' project that can be controlled using slider variables. The theme of the project and the way the sprites look and move, is up to you. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

See how the **Moon** sprite is able to rise from behind the **Rooftops** sprite because **Rooftops** is a sprite rather than a part of the backdrop.

+ The backdrop is **always** at the back and cannot move
+ Sprites can move around the screen, and be infront of or behind other sprites

Take a look at these 3D scene projects, and adjust any sliders you see.

+ Can you see which sprites are in front of other sprites?
+ Can you tell what effect each variable slider has?
