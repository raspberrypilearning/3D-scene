## Get inspiration

You are going to create a '3D scene' project that can be controlled using slider variables. The theme of the project and the way the sprites look and move, is up to you. You will also choose which variables to add and how they are used to change the scene to get the effect you want. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

In the example below, the moon can be programmed to rise about the silhouetted **Rooftops** because they are both sprites. By developing some of your scenery as sprites you can create some interesting, 3-dimensional effects which will make your scenery appear more realistic.
