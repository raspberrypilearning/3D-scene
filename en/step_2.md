## Get inspiration

You are going to create a '3D scene' project that can be controlled using slider variables. The theme of the project and the way the sprites look and move, is up to you. You will also choose which variables to add and how they are used to change the scene to get the effect you want. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

Click the green flag below to **play with** the example Scratch project. Click the red stop icon above the stage when you have finished with a project so that it stops playing sound. The project will stop after 30 seconds. Click the green flag again if you need more time.

Imagine a stage in the theatre. Look at the examples below which is made up of a backdrop and a number of sprites to create a 3D scene:

Objects which are already drawn onto a backdrop are not sprites so they cannot be layered or programmed and therefore cannot be animated. In the below example, the **Jellyfish**, **Puffafish** and **Scuba diver** sprites move but the underwater plants, which are drawn on the backdrop, are static.

As in the theatre, a characters or charcaters moves through the scenery:

Things which appear behind other objects or characters (layers) and are smaller and lighter in colour look further away from the audience/user. These are useful 3-dimensional effects which can be used to create a greater sense of depth. They help to make your project appear more realistic.
