## Get inspiration

You are going to create an 'Interactive animation' project to change someone's mood. The theme of the project, how it looks, and the way the sprites move, is up to you. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

Click the green flags below to **play with** the example Scratch projects. Can you spot features that make the scenes look 3-dimensional? Do some things look further away than others? Do some things seem to be in front of others? Drag the sliders and see what changes. 

Give some thought to **your** 3D scene, how it will look, what 3D effects will it use, what will the user be able to control?:
