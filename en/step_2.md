You are going to create a '3D scene' project that can be controlled using slider variables. The theme of the project and the way the sprites look and move, is up to you. You will also choose which variables to add and how they are used to change the scene to get the effect you want. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

The wooden chair in the below example is drawn onto a backdrop. It is not a sprite so it cannot be layered or programmed and therefore cannot be animated. The **Wheelchair** sprite can be programmed. By developing some of your scenery as sprites you can create some interesting, 3-dimensional effects which will make your scenery appear more realistic.

Sprites which sit behind other sprites, are smaller and lighter in colour appear further away from the audience/user. Layers, size and colour are useful 3-dimensional effects which can be used to create a greater sense of depth and help to make '3D scene' projects appear more realistic.
