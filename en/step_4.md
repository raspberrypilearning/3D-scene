## Scenery

You have selected a backdrop. Now it's time to think about what **objects** you want in your **scenery**. In this step you will create your own objects as sprite costumes in **Paint Editor**.

**ADD TO STEP 3? Objects which are already drawn onto a Backdrop cannot be individually programmed. Choose a simple backdrop with just a few or no objects drawn on it or design your own background. This will give you more freedom as you go on to develop your project by animating your scenery. WHERE TO ADD INFO ON DESIGNING TEIR OWN - STEP 3 OR4 ?**

In the real world, a backdrop if often static such as a street, hills or an internal wall. Added to this are objects such as people, vehicles and furniture which are able to move in front of the backdrop. In Scratch, you can create some interesting and more realistic effects by developing some of your backdrop as sprites. 

Then, for example, the sun will be able to go behind the trees because they are both sprites.

Unlike the real world, the trees can also move if they are sprites because they are not drawn onto the backdrop. This can create a greater sense of movement of another sprite, such as a car, driving in the foreground. Notice the car is not moving, but the trees are.

If some of your background objects are sprites you will be able to create a greater sense of 3-dimensions and, in some instance, make you animation appear more realistic.

In order to program aspects of your backdrop you will now add objects as sprites. You may need to change or alter your backdrop if the one you have chosen won't allow you to realise your project ideas.

To use **Paint Editor** effectively you need to be familiar with the difference between vector and bitmap graphics.

Layers can be used to change the way a sprite appears in relation to other sprites. Layering also helps sprites appear to sit three-dimensional within a scene. You can layer all your sprites. The important thing is to remember the order that you want the sprites to sit.

For now, organise your sprites into their layering position by dragging them in front of one another. In the next step, you will program your sprites so they are organised into those layers.

You can create sprites which are the same colour or texture as the background so they are invisible but can be layered. Another sprite can then **appear** to come out from behind the invisible sprite.

In addition to coding layers to create a sense of 3-dimensions, in the next step you will also change the size of sprites in relation to each other. This will help to create a greater sense of depth to your scenery. Bigger sprites appear to be closer to the front of the stage with smaller sprites appearing further away.

Some sprites can be the size of the stage and sit in the scene as the front layer. The interactive animation will then appear to happen **through** this sprite just like looking through a window, binoculars or a mask.

In your scenery, you may want to create multiple copies of a shape within a costume so whether the sprite is static or moving your scenery will appear busier. This effect is used by proffessional animators to create weather patterns such as rain or clouds, to create a cluster of objects such as buildings and tree and to create the impression of a crowd of people in a scene.
