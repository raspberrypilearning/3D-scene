## Scenery

You have selected a backdrop. Now it's time to think about what **objects** you want in your **scenery**. In this step you will be using **Paint Editor** to design your own objects.

--- task ---

You cannot individually program objects which are already drawn onto a Backdrop. Often it is easier to choose a simple backdrop with just a few or no objects on it or design your own background, adding the objects you need into your scene. This will give you more freedom as you go on to develop your project.

![Backdrop without furniture/objects](images/challenge2-backdrop-no-objects.png){:width="400px"}

![Sprite furniture/objects](images/challenge2-objects.png){:width="400px"}

You may need to change your backdrop if the one you have chosen won't work well or make a new backdrop.

In the real world, a backdrop if often static such as a street, hills or an internal wall with objects such as people, vehicles and furniture being able to move in front  of the backdrop. However, in Scratch, you can create some interesting effects by moving some of your backdrop. For instance, in Dinosaur, the mountains move because they are sprites which are not drawn onto the backdrop. This creates a greater sense of the dinosuar's own movement when it runs left and right.

If some of your background objects are sprites you can create a greater sense of 3-dimensions.

To use **Paint Editor** effectively you need to be familiar with difference between vector and bitmap graphics.

Layers can be used to change the way a sprite appears in relation to other sprites. Layering helps sprites appear to sit three-dimensional within a scene. You can include a number of sprites in layers. he improtant thing is to remember the order that you want the sprites to sit.

For now, organise your sprites into their position by dragging them in front of one another. In the next step, you will program your sprites so they are organised into those layers.

--- task ---

You can create sprites which are the same colour or texture as the background so they are invisible. Because it is a sprite it can be layered. This means that another sprite can **appears** to come out from behind the background wheninfact it is comingout from behind the invisible sprite.

In addition to coding layers to create a sense of 3-dimensions, in the next step you willa lso changing the size of sprites in relation to each other. This will help to create a sense of depth to your scene. Bigger sprites appear to be closer to the front ofthe stage with smalled sprites appearing further away.

Some sprites can be the size of the stage and sit as the front layer. The interactive animation will appear to happen **through** this sprite. It acts as a viewer, window, template or mask.

In your scenery, you may want to create multiple copies of a shape within a costume to create a busier scene. For instance, a number of clouds, a cluster of trees or a crowd scene.
