## Scenery

You have selected a backdrop. Now it's time to think about what **objects** you want in your **scenery**. In this step you will create your own objects as sprite costumes in **Paint Editor**.

--- task ---

In the real world, a backdrop if often static such as internal walls, a street or hills. Added to this are objects such as people, vehicles and furniture which are able to move in front of the backdrop. In Scratch, by developing some of your backdrop as sprites you can create some interesting, 3-dimensions effects which will make your scenery appear more realistic.

For example, the moon can rise above the hill because they are both sprites.

![Sprite moon goes behind sprite trees](images/challenge2-moon-rising.gif)

Unlike the real world, buildings for example, can move if they are sprites as long as they are not drawn onto the backdrop. This can create a sense of movement of another sprite, such as a car, driving in the foreground. Notice the buildings are moving, not the car.

![Sprite car stays still, street moves](images/challenge2-car-driving.gif){:width="400px"}

In order to program aspects of your backdrop you will now add objects as sprites. You may need to change or alter your backdrop if the one you have chosen won't allow you to realise your project ideas because it has drawn objects rather than objects as sprites. Below shows an example where the drawn object may be visually in the way of your project:
+ a Backdrop with a drawn chair
+ a wheelchair as a sprite
+ the wheelchair as a sprite with the Backdrop

The backdrop is the very back of your scene - it might be a skyline, a street, a forest or a bedroom wall - whatever suits your project best. 

Below is an example of a blue **Backdrop** with hills as sprite costumes. You can use the example to create the Backdrop and objects you require in your scenery.

To create a sky blue backdrop go to **Backdrops** and select **Paint**.

![Select sprite paint](images/challenge2-backdrop-paint.png){:width="400px"}

In the **Backdrops tab** and  select a suitable **Fill** colour with no **Outline**. Go to the **Rectangle** shape and draw a rectangle, ensuring you cover all of the stage area shown as an outline in the **Paint Editor).

![Select Fill and Outline](images/challenge2-backdrop-fill-outline.gif){:width="400px"}

Now go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume - a number of hills.

![Make hills as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costumes.gif){:width="400px"}

Choose a colour and a series of ovals using the **Circle** tool. Draw a number of ovals and a rectangle at the bottom of the **Costume Editor**.

![Make hills saturated](images/challenge2-saturation-front-back.png){:width="400px"}

Objects that sit further away in your scene could appear lighter in colour - to achieve this you can lower the sprite costume's colour **Saturation**. The sprite costume will then appear further away. Altering the colour saturation to create a sense of depth is a traditional technique used by landscape painters.

Now select the shapes and **Group** them together. You will now be able to adjust or move them as one shape.

![Group shapes](images/challenge2-group-shapes.png){:width="400px"}

Don't forget to title your sprite.

You can always add shapes as sprites instead of shapes in a sprite costume, if this suits your project.

In the **Paint Editor** there are two graphics settings: **vector** and **bitmap**.

Build your confidence with vector and bitmap graphics when developing sprite costumes by exploring the **How to...** below.

title: Vector and bitmap graphics in the Costume Editor

The **Costume Editor** automatically opens in the vector graphic setting.

![Vector](images/challenge2-vector.png){:width="400px"}


You can go to bitmaps by selecting the blue button **Convert to Bitmap** if you would prefer to use pen marks to develop your sprite costume:


![Bitmap](images/challenge2-bitmap.png){:width="400px"}


Vector and bitmap graphics have different **Costume Editors** whilst offering similar tools. Vector has an additional tool, **Reshape**:


![Vector Reshape tool](images/challenge2-vector-reshape-tool.png){:width="150px"}


Using this tool you can move the position of the **nodes**, turn or pull the **handles**, and add more nodes to your shape:

--- /no-print ---

**Vector graphics** are made up of splines (mathmatical curves) and appear as shapes with a set of control points which means they can be reshaped easily and still maintain a high resolution (smooth appearance).

**Bitmap graphics** are made from grids of pixels, they tend to be low resolution (low quality) and may appear a little 'blocky', expecially when the image is enlarged.

Using your chosen sprite, go to the **Paint Editor** and zoom in on a bitmap graphic using the maginifing tool where you will see the grids of pixels. On a vector graphic there are no pixels, just control points.

Layers can be used to change the way a sprite appears in relation to other sprites. Layering also helps sprites appear to sit three-dimensional within a scene. All sprites can be layered. The important thing is to correctly order the layers that you want the sprites to sit!

--- task ---

For now, organise your sprites into their layer position by dragging them in front of one another. In the next step, you will program your sprites so they are organised into those layers.

You can create sprites which are the same colour or texture as the background so they are invisible but can be layered. Another sprite can then **appear** to come out from behind the invisible sprite.

In your 3D scene, you may want to create multiple copies of a shape within a costume so your scenery will appear busier. This effect is used by professional animators to create weather patterns (rain and clouds), to create a cluster of objects such as buildings or a wood as well as create the impression of a crowd of people in a scene.

--- no-print ---

Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Cloud**. Go to  the **Select** tool and select all of the cloud shape. You can create multiples of this shape by using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools. Move the shapes around using the **Select** tools. Vary to shapes by making them bigger and smaller. This will  help to create a greater sense of 3D-dimensions.

Sprites as large as the Stage can sit in the 3D scene as the foreground (the very front layer). The scene will then appear **through** this sprite just like looking through the bars of a cage, a window, binoculars or a mask.

Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint**, choose a colour and draw a rectangle. You can repeat this shape by using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools. Move the shapes around using the **Select** tool.

In addition to coding layers to create a sense of 3-dimensions, in the next step you will also change the size of sprites in relation to each other. This will help to create a greater sense of depth to your scenery. Bigger sprites appear to be closer to the front of the stage with smaller sprites appearing further away.
