## Set the scene

In this step you will set the scene by creating or choosing a backdrop. You will also  create and/or make sprites go in your scenery in frontoft he backdrp.

A Backdrop is **always** at the back and cannot move. In this example project, the Backdrop is the **Sky**. 

Sprites can move around the stage, and be in front of or behind other sprites. In this example project the **Shark** sprite is able to jump from behind the waves because the waves are not drawn on the backdrop. **Waves** are a sprite.

Use the Paint editor to create your own backdrop and scenery sprites OR **Choose a Backdrop** from the Scratch library.

title: Create a plain backdrop

In the **Walking in the hills** example, a dark blue backdrop has been created. Any additional scenery, such as hills, trees or buildings can be added as sprites that can then be moved around.

To make your own backdrop:
+ Go to the Stage pane and click on **backdrop1**.

![Select sprite paint](images/challenge2-backdrop-paint.png){:width="400px"}

+ Click on the **Backdrops** tab.
+ Select a suitable **Fill** colour with no **Outline**.
+ Go to the **Rectangle** tool and draw a rectangle, ensuring you cover all of the stage area (shown as an outline in the Paint editor).

Don't forget to name your backdrop.

Add any sprites that you want to use from the gallery. This could include people, animals or vehicles. It can also include existing scenery sprites such as trees, rocks or buildings. 

Remember all sprites in Scratch can move so if you want your main character to be a bunch of bananas, that's fine!

**Tip:** Whenever you drag a sprite it will jump to the front layer and in front of any other sprites.

Use the Paint editor to create any additional sprites that you need as scenery. This could be hills or mountains in the distance, or smaller sprites, such as trees or flowers, fro your scenery. 

Think about whether you want to create your scenery as one sprite OR whether you want some of your sprites to move through and behind the 3D scenery by creating separate scenery sprites. The latter will make it easier for you to move sprites around later depending on your ideas for your project.

![Hills image](images/challenge2-sprite-hill.png){:width="400px"}

You can make your own **Hills** sprite shown in the example above by using the **Circle** and **Rectangle** tools in the Paint editor:

+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume.

![Make a hill as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costume.gif){:width="400px"}

+ Choose a **Fill** colour and deselect **Outline**. Now draw an oval using the **Circle** tool. Then select the **Rectangle** tool to draw a rectangle underneath the oval.

+ If you use varying colours for the shapes you may need to use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the **Paint editor** to move your shapes forward or backwards so they sit correctly within your background.

+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.

title: Create scenery as separate sprites

**Hills as separate sprites**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/452573711/editor){:target="_blank"}

You can create objects in your scenery as separate sprites so that other sprites can move between them. You can make the hills in the example above or you can apply these skills to make your own sprites using the **Circle** and **Rectangle** tools in the Paint editor:

You can create a new sprite for each object in your 3D scenery. In the below example, each hill is a sprite.

![Make hills as a number of sprite](images/challenge2-scenery-sprites.png){:width="400px"}

You can also create a sprite that combines objects. In the below example, there are two hills in one sprite:

![Make hills as a number of sprite](images/challenge2-scenery-combine-sprites.png){:width="400px"}

+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume which in this example will be hills.

+ Choose a **Fill** colour and deselect the **Outline** tool. Draw an oval using the **Circle** tool. Then draw a rectangle at the bottom of the circle using the same **Fill** colour.

![Group shapes](images/challenge2-group-shapes.png){:width="400px"}

Now make another **Hill** sprite. You may want to include a number of hills for your scenery in a single sprite or create a new sprite for each. Follow the same process above using the **Circle** tool only. 

In the real-world, objects that sit further away appear lighter in colour - to achieve a more realistic effect you can lower the colour **Saturation** of the ovals that are smaller to make them appear further away.

Here's some other creative tips:

title: Create a triangle using the line tool

---

You can create polygons such as a triangle and use these shapes to create roofs or mountains.

Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume which in this example will be houses.

**House**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/453595663/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Make houses as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costumes-line-tool.gif){:width="400px"}

Following the below, you can create any shape using the **Line** tool:
+ Choose a **Fill** colour with no outline
+ Draw a rectangle using the **Rectangle** tool
+ Draw a triangle using the **Line** tool. Make sure you complete the trangle otherwise it will not fill with colour
+ Move the two shapes together
+ Select the **Bucket** tool and fill the triangle
+ Draw another rectangle shape for the chimney using the **Rectangle** tool
+ You can use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the **Paint editor** to move your shapes forward or backwards so they sit correctly. You won't need to do this for this example because the shapes are black for the silhouette
+ Select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape

To create duplicate shapes such as a skyline from your house, follow the **How to...** 'Create a scenery costume by duplicating shapes' below.

title: Create a scenery costume by duplicating shapes

---

In your 3D scene, you may want to duplicate shapes within a costume so your scenery will appear busier or more crowded.

**Multiple clouds**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/447278432/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Multiple cloud shapes](images/challenge2-sprite-costume-multiples.png){:width="400px"}

The effect of multiplying shapes is used by professional animators to create the impression of: weather patterns such as rain or clouds; a cluster of objects such as buildings or a wood; as well as a crowd of people in a scene.

![Costume with multiple cloud shapes](images/challenge2-sprite-costume-multiples.gif)

--- /no-print ---

Following the below, you can multiply any type of shape:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select, in this example, the **Cloud** sprite
+ In the **Costumes editor**, using the **Select** tool highlight the whole of the shape
+ Create multiples of the shape using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools
+ Move the shape within the stage area using the **Select** tool
+ Varying the size of the shapes will also help to create a greater sense of 3D-dimensions
+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape

--- /task ---

**Tip:** If you find it hard to manage the sprites on your stage, such as having a large sprite that keeps covering a much smaller one, you can click **hide** so you don't see the sprite or sprites. Then click **show** again when you're done.

As you add more sprites you will need to think about how they will work together in your scene. 

Here's another example:

title: Create a sprite with gaps that you can see through

---

You can view your 3D scene **through** a sprite. If it sits as the front layer and is the size of the stage it can appear like a view through the bars of a cage or a series of window panes.

Following the below, you can any type of masking sprite:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint**
+ Choose a colour with no **Outline** and draw a vertical rectangle. 
+ Repeat this shape by using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools. 
+ Move the shapes around using the **Select** tool 
+ As you place your shapes make sure they are touching the edge of the stage to fit in with your project idea
