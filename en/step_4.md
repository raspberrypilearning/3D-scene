## Scenery

You have selected a backdrop. Now it's time to think about what **objects** you want in your **scenery**. In this step you will create your own objects as sprite costumes in **Paint Editor**.

--- task ---

In the real world, a backdrop if often static such as internal walls, a street or hills. Added to this are objects such as people, vehicles and furniture which are able to move in front of the backdrop. In Scratch, by developing some of your backdrop as sprites you can create some interesting, 3-dimensions effects which will make your scenery appear more realistic.

For example, the moon can rise above the hill because they are both sprites.

Unlike the real world, buildings for example, can move if they are sprites as long as they are not drawn onto the backdrop. This can create a sense of movement of another sprite, such as a car, driving in the foreground. Notice the buildings are moving, not the car.

In order to program aspects of your backdrop you will now add objects as sprites. You may need to change or alter your backdrop if the one you have chosen won't allow you to realise your project ideas because it has drawn objects rather than objects as sprites. Below shows an example where the drawn object may be visually in the way of your project:
+ a Backdrop with a drawn chair
+ a wheelchair as a sprite
+ the wheelchair as a sprite with the Backdrop

The backdrop is the very back of your scene - it might be a skyline, a street, a forest or a bedroom wall - whatever suits your project best. Here's an example of making a blue **Backdrop** with hills as sprite costumes. Use the example to create the objects you require in your scenery.

To create a sky blue backdrop go to **Backdrops** and select **Paint**.

![Select sprite paint](images/challenge2-backdrop-paint.png){:width="400px"}

In **Backdrops tab** select a suitable **Fill** colour and no **Outline**. Go to the **Rectangle** shape and draw a rectangle, ensuring you cover all of the stage area shown as an outline in the **Paint Editor).

Select **Paint** when creating a new sprite to go direct to the **Paint Editor**

Don't forget to name you sprite.

To use **Paint Editor** effectively you need to be familiar with the difference between vector and bitmap graphics.

Layers can be used to change the way a sprite appears in relation to other sprites. Layering also helps sprites appear to sit three-dimensional within a scene. You can layer all your sprites. The important thing is to remember the order that you want the sprites to sit.

--- task ---

For now, organise your sprites into their layering position by dragging them in front of one another. In the next step, you will program your sprites so they are organised into those layers.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You can create sprites which are the same colour or texture as the background so they are invisible but can be layered. Another sprite can then **appear** to come out from behind the invisible sprite.

In addition to coding layers to create a sense of 3-dimensions, in the next step you will also change the size of sprites in relation to each other. This will help to create a greater sense of depth to your scenery. Bigger sprites appear to be closer to the front of the stage with smaller sprites appearing further away.

Some sprites can be the size of the stage and sit in the scene as the front layer. The interactive animation will then appear to happen **through** this sprite just like looking through a window, binoculars or a mask.

In your scenery, you may want to create multiple copies of a shape within a costume so whether the sprite is static or moving your scenery will appear busier. This effect is used by proffessional animators to create weather patterns such as rain or clouds, to create a cluster of objects such as buildings and tree and to create the impression of a crowd of people in a scene.
