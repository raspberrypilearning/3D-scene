## Set your scene

In this step you will create scenery with one backdrop and a series of sprites. In the next step, you will be programming your sprites so don't worry about that now.

**Tip:** Whenever you click on a sprite it will jump to the front layer and in in front of any other sprites.

First, you will make or choose a backdrop.

Either you will choose a relatively plain backdrop from the Scratch backdrop library, or you are going to work with the **Paint editor** where there are two types of graphics options: **vector** and **bitmap**. The **backdrop editor** automatically opens in the vector graphic setting and you will be using vector graphics for this project.

**Blue sky**:
![Blue sky image](images/blueSkyBackdrop.png){:width="400px"}

In this example a plain blue sky backdrop has been created because any additional scenery, such as hills, trees or buildings will be added as sprites that can be moved around.

To make your own backdrop:
+ Go to the **Stage pane**, click **Backdrops** and selecting **Paint**.

![Select sprite paint](images/challenge2-backdrop-paint.png){:width="400px"}

+ In the **Backdrops** tab, select a suitable **Fill** colour with no **Outline**. Go to the **Rectangle** shape and draw a rectangle, ensuring you cover all of the stage area (shown as an outline in the **Paint Editor**).

Don't forget to name your backdrop.

Next, you will choose or create sprites that will act as scenery. This could be hills or mountain in the distance, or objects much closer such as trees or flowers. 

If you like, you can combine sprites from the Scratch library and your own sprites created in the **Paint Editor**.

**Hills**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/445193602/editor){:target="_blank"}
![Hills image](images/challenge2-sprite-hills.png){:width="400px"}

This example has build a hills sprite that sits in front of the blue sky backdrop.

These hills have been created as a single sprite but you could also create each hill as an individual sprite making it easy for you to move things around later.

title: Create scenery sprites

This example is to make the hills shown above, but you can apply these skills to make your own sprites using the Circle or Rectangle tools in the **Paint Editor**:

+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume which in this example will be hills.

![Make hills as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costumes.gif){:width="400px"}

+ Choose a colour and draw a series of ovals using the **Circle** tool. Then draw a rectangle at the bottom of the circles using the same **Fill** colour.

In the real-world, objects that sit further away appear lighter in colour - to achieve a more realistic effect you can lower the colour **Saturation** of the ovals that are smaller to make them appear further away.

![Make hills saturated](images/challenge2-saturation.png){:width="400px"}

+ Use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the **Paint editor** to move your shapes forward or backwards so they sit correctly within your background.

![Make hills saturated](images/challenge2-saturation-front-back.png){:width="400px"}

+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.

![Group shapes](images/challenge2-group-shapes.png){:width="400px"}

+ Don't forget to name your sprites.

**Tip:** If you find it hard to manage the sprites on your stage, such as having a large sprite that keeps covering a much smaller one, you can toggle any sprite to be hidden while you don't need to see it.

Here's some other tools you can use in the Paint editor. Use the tools and techniques that fit into your project idea.

title: Create a sprite using the Line tool

---

Following the same method you used on the above task to make hills, you can create geometric shapes such as traingle. This example creates a single house in silhouette.

Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume which in this example will be houses.

**House**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/447278432/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Make houses as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costumes-line-tool.gif){:width="400px"}

Following the below, you can any shape using the linetool:
+ Choose a **Fill** colour with no outline
+ Draw a rectangle using the **Rectangle** tool
+ Draw a triangle using the **Line** tool. Make sure you complete the trangle otherwise it will not fill with colour
+ Move the two shapes together
+ Select the **Bucket** tool and fill the triangle
+ Draw another rectangle shape for the chimney using the **Rectangle** tool
+ You can use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the **Paint editor** to move your shapes forward or backwards so they sit correctly. You won't need to do this for this example because the shapes are black for the silhouette
+ Select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape

To make multiples of your shapes such as a skyline of houses, follow the **How to...** 'Multiple shapes in a sprite costume' below.

title: Create a sprite costume with multiple shapes

---

In your 3D scene, you may want to create multiple copies of a shape within a costume so your scenery will appear busier or more crowded.

**Multiple clouds**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/447278432/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Multiple cloud shapes](images/challenge2-sprite-costume-multiples.png){:width="400px"}

The effect of multiplying shapes is used by professional animators to create the impression of: weather patterns such as rain or clouds; a cluster of objects such as buildings or a wood; as well as a crowd of people in a scene.

--- /no-print ---

Following the below, you can multiply any type of shape:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select, in this example, the **Cloud** sprite
+ In the **Costumes editor**, using the **Select** tool highlight the whole of the shape
+ Create multiples of the shape using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools
+ Move the shape within the stage area using the **Select** tool
+ Varying the size of the shapes will also help to create a greater sense of 3D-dimensions
+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape

You can create shapes as individual sprites rather than as one sprite costume. Then another sprite can move between the shapes. This may suit your project.

title: Create a masking sprite

---

You can view your 3D scene **through** a **Masking** sprite. If it sits as the front layer and is the size of the stage it will look like view through the bars of a cage or a series of window panes, surveying a scene through binoculars or wearing a mask.

Following the below, you can any type of masking sprite:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint**
+ Choose a colour with no **Outline** and draw a vertical rectangle. 
+ Repeat this shape by using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools. 
+ Move the shapes around using the **Select** tool 
+ As you place your shapes make sure they are touching the edge of the stage to fit in with your project idea
