## Set the scene

In this step you will set the scene by adding a backdrop and sprites.

In the next step, you will be programming your sprites so don't worry about coding for now.

Use the **Paint Editor** to create your own backdrop and scenery sprites if you don't find what you need when you **Choose a Backdrop** from the Scratch library.

title: Create a plain backdrop

---

**Blue sky**:
In the example a dark blue backdrop has been created because any additional scenery, such as hills, trees or buildings will be added as sprites that can be moved around.

To make your own backdrop:
+ Go to the **Stage pane**, click **Backdrops** and selecting **Paint**.

![Select sprite paint](images/challenge2-backdrop-paint.png){:width="400px"}

+ In the **Backdrops** tab, select a suitable **Fill** colour with no **Outline**. Go to the **Rectangle** shape and draw a rectangle, ensuring you cover all of the stage area (shown as an outline in the **Paint Editor**). 

![Select Fill and Outline](images/challenge2-backdrop-fill-outline.gif){:width="400px"}

Don't forget to name your backdrop.

title: Choose a backdrop from the Scratch library

In the bottom-right corner of the Stage pane, click on **Choose a Backdrop**.

You can search for a backdrop, or browse for one by category or theme. Click on a backdrop to select it.

Add any sprites that you want to use from the gallery. This could include people, animals or vehicles. It can also include existing scenery sprites such as trees, rocks or buildings. 

Remember all sprites in Scratch can move so if you want your main character to be a bunch of bananas, that's fine!

title: Add sprites from the gallery

In the Sprite pane, click **Choose a Sprite** to see the library of all Scratch sprites.

You can search or browse sprites by theme. Click on a sprite to add it to your project.

**Tip:** Whenever you drag a sprite it will jump to the front layer and in front of any other sprites.

Use the **Paint Editor** to create any additional sprite that you need as scenery. This could be hills or mountain in the distance, or objects much closer such as trees or flowers.

title: Create a scenery sprite with shapes

---

**Hills**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/445193602/editor){:target="_blank"}
![Hills image](images/challenge2-sprite-hills.png){:width="400px"}

This example has a single **Hills** sprite that sits in front of the drak blue sky backdrop, but you could also create each hill as an individual sprite making it easy for you to move things around later.


You can make the hills shown above or you can apply these skills to make your own sprites using the **Circle** or **Rectangle** tools in the **Paint Editor**:

+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume which in this example will be hills.

![Make hills as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costumes.gif){:width="400px"}

+ Choose a colour and draw a series of ovals using the **Circle** tool. Then draw a rectangle at the bottom of the circles using the same **Fill** colour.

In the real-world, objects that sit further away appear lighter in colour - to achieve a more realistic effect you can lower the colour **Saturation** of the ovals that are smaller to make them appear further away.

![Make hills saturated](images/challenge2-saturation.png){:width="400px"}

+ Use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the **Paint editor** to move your shapes forward or backwards so they sit correctly within your background.

![Make hills saturated](images/challenge2-saturation-front-back.png){:width="400px"}

+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.

+ Don't forget to name your sprites.

title: Create a scenery costume using copy and paste

---

In your 3D scene, you may want to create multiple copies of a shape within a costume so your scenery will appear busier or more crowded.

**Multiple clouds**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/447278432/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Multiple cloud shapes](images/challenge2-sprite-costume-multiples.png){:width="400px"}

The effect of multiplying shapes is used by professional animators to create the impression of: weather patterns such as rain or clouds; a cluster of objects such as buildings or a wood; as well as a crowd of people in a scene.

![Costume with multiple cloud shapes](images/challenge2-sprite-costume-multiples.gif)

--- /no-print ---

Following the below, you can multiply any type of shape:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select, in this example, the **Cloud** sprite
+ In the **Costumes editor**, using the **Select** tool highlight the whole of the shape
+ Create multiples of the shape using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools
+ Move the shape within the stage area using the **Select** tool
+ Varying the size of the shapes will also help to create a greater sense of 3D-dimensions
+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape

title: Create triangles using the line tool

---

Following the same method you used on the above task to make hills, you can create polygons such as triangle. This example creates a single house in silhouette.

Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume which in this example will be houses.

**House**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/447278432/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Make houses as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costumes-line-tool.gif){:width="400px"}

Following the below, you can any shape using the linetool:
+ Choose a **Fill** colour with no outline
+ Draw a rectangle using the **Rectangle** tool
+ Draw a triangle using the **Line** tool. Make sure you complete the trangle otherwise it will not fill with colour
+ Move the two shapes together
+ Select the **Bucket** tool and fill the triangle
+ Draw another rectangle shape for the chimney using the **Rectangle** tool
+ You can use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the **Paint editor** to move your shapes forward or backwards so they sit correctly. You won't need to do this for this example because the shapes are black for the silhouette
+ Select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape

To make multiples of your shapes such as a skyline of houses, follow the **How to...** 'Multiple shapes in a sprite costume' below.

**Tip:** If you find it hard to manage the sprites on your stage, such as having a large sprite that keeps covering a much smaller one, you can toggle any sprite to be hidden while you don't need to see it.

--- task ---
As you add more sprites you will need to think about how they will work together in your scene. 

Here are some more examples:

title: Create separate scenery sprites so characters can go behind them

---

You can create shapes as individual sprites rather than as one sprite costume. Then another sprite can move between the shapes. This may suit your project. 

**Hills as sprites**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/446137341/editor){:target="_blank"}

title: Create a sprite with gaps that you can see through

---

You can view your 3D scene **through** a **Masking** sprite. If it sits as the front layer and is the size of the stage it will look like view through the bars of a cage or a series of window panes, surveying a scene through binoculars or wearing a mask.

Following the below, you can any type of masking sprite:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint**
+ Choose a colour with no **Outline** and draw a vertical rectangle. 
+ Repeat this shape by using the **Copy** and **Paste** tools. 
+ Move the shapes around using the **Select** tool 
+ As you place your shapes make sure they are touching the edge of the stage to fit in with your project idea
