## Scenery

In the previous step you selected a backdrop. Now it's time to think about how you want to create your **scenery**. In this step you will be using **Paint Editor** to design your own sprite objects for your scenery.

--- task ---

If you chose a backdrop that already has objects drawn in it, remember you will not be able to animate the objects because theyare drawn onto the backdrop. 

Although these type of backdrops can work well, in your interactive animation it may be easier to choose a simple backdrop or design your own background, adding the objects you need in to your scene as **sprites** which you can then individually control with code. Evenif you backdrop has some objects drawn in it, make sure some ofthe objects in your scene are sprites - this will give you more freedom as you go on to develop your project.

Decide if you want to continue to use the Scratch backdrop you have chosen (changing the backdrop is easy). You may want to design your own background or do a bit of both. Whether you are using a backdrop or making a background, for the remainer of this project we will refer to the very back of your scene as the **background**.

In the real world, the background if often static such as buildings or hills with objects such as people, vehicles and furniture being able to move around. But in Scratch you can create some great effects by moving parts of your backdrop. In Dinosaur, for instance, the mountains can move becausetheyare sprites which creates a greater sense of the dinosuar's own movement when it runs left and right.

If some of your background objects are sprites you can create a greater sense of 3-dimensions.

To use **Paint Editor** effectively you need to be familiar with difference between vector and bitmap graphics.

Layers can be used to change the way a sprite appears in relation to other sprites. Layering helps sprites appear to sit three-dimensional within a scene. You can include a number of sprites in layers. he improtant thing is to remember the order that you want the sprites to sit.

For now, organise your sprites into their position by dragging them in front of one another. In the next step, you will program your sprites so they are organised into those layers.

--- task ---

You can create sprites which are the same colour or texture as the background so they are invisible. Because it is a sprite it can be layered. This means that another sprite can **appears** to come out from behind the background wheninfact it is comingout from behind the invisible sprite.

In addition to coding layers to create a sense of 3-dimensions, in the next step you willa lso changing the size of sprites in relation to each other. This will help to create a sense of depth to your scene. Bigger sprites appear to be closer to the front ofthe stage with smalled sprites appearing further away.

Some sprites can be the size of the stage and sit as the front layer. The interactive animation will appear to happen **through** this sprite. It acts as a viewer, window, template or mask.

In your scenery, you may want to create multiple copies of a shape within a costume to create a busier scene. For instance, a number of clouds, a cluster of trees or a crowd scene.
