## Sound

Now you're going to add some `sounds`{:class="block3sound"} to your project. Depending on your plans, this could be a continuous background soundtrack or sounds that happen at a specific time, such as when a new sprite appears.

--- task ---
 
Think about what kind of sound you want and when you want that sound to happen.
 
This project has a soundtrack that runs throughout, plus the **Hen** sprite makes a sound every three seconds:

There are two `sounds`{:class="block3sound"} blocks with very important differences that you need to understand.

+ When you `play a sound until done`{:class="block3sound"}, the sound will play all the way through until Scratch runs the next line of code in that script. 
+ When you `start a sound`{:class="block3sound"}, the sound will play but the next line of code will run immeadiately and will not wait for the sound to finish first.

This means that if you had a series of `start a sound`{:class="block3sound"} blocks the sounds would all play almost at the same time, layered on top of each other. The effect can be interesting and sometimes messy.

Have a play with it sometime!

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
start sound (meow v)
start sound (alien Creak2 v)
start sound (Boing v)
start sound (Boom Cloud v)
start sound (Baa v)

title: Adding a sound
---

Start by selecting the sprite that you want to have the new sound and select the Sounds tab. Each sprite starts with a default sound.

![Sound tab](images/soundTab.png)

To get to Scratch's library of built-in sounds, click on the **Choose a sound** button.

![Choose a sound button](images/chooseASoundButton.png)

If you hover your mouse over the play symbol of a sound, Scratch will preview the sound for you.

![Preview a sound](images/soundPreview.png)

Click on any sound to add it to your sprite. You will be taken straight back to the Sounds tab and you will be able to see the sound that you just added.

![Sounds tab with new sound](images/newSoundAdded.png)

If you switch to the Code tab and look at the `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} blocks, you will see you the new sound available in the sound playing blocks.

Add code to run `sounds`{:class="block3sound"} blocks where you want sound in your project.
 
Have a look at the how toâ€™s below that will help you to add the kind of sounds that you want for your project:

</div>
 
Usually a continuous background soundtrack will start at the beginning when the `green flag`{:class="block3events"} is clicked, but you could have it starting at any time that suits your project.

To make a sound play continuously, use a `play a sound until done`{:class="block3sound"} block inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop. Once the sound has finished, the `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop makes the sound start again from the beginning.

This example uses a single long sound clip repeated as a soundtrack.
 
```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever
play sound (Dance Snare Beat v) until done
end
```

**Note:** When choosing a new sound, if you select Loops, Scratch will only show you the loops which are mostly the ones suitable for a simgle looping soundtrack.

Some Scratch sprites have costumes that can be used to create a simple animation.

Rather than using a single longer looping sound, you may want to loop a series of shorter sounds together. You may want to have a certain sequence of sounds playing in order or perhaps you are just having fun playing with the different sounds, or even composing a piece of music using different instrument notes and effects.

Unless you have a clear idea of what sounds you want to use and their order, the first step would be to get a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop, pick out some sounds you like and experiment.
 
```blocks3
forever
play sound (Low Boing v) until done
play sound (Low Boing v) until done
play sound (Drum Buzz v) until done
play sound (Pop v) until done
play sound (Bird v) until done
play sound (Bark v) until done
play sound (Glug v) until done
End
```
 
If you click on the `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop, it will keep repeating whatever is inside. As you change the order or the sounds inside, Scratch will play your latest version each time it loops around.

**Note:** The example only uses `play a sound until done`{:class="block3sound"} blocks, so that each sound finishes before the next begin. As you experiment, you might want to try adding some `start sound`{:class="block3sound"} blocks in where you want more than one sound to play at once. For intance you may want to have `start Bark sound`{:class="block3sound"} followed by `play Bird until done`{:class="block3sound"} to get a bird sound and a bark at the same time.

```blocks3
forever
play sound (Low Boing v) until done
start sound (Pop v)
start sound (Finger Snap v)
play sound (Drum Buzz v) until done
+ start sound (Bark v)
+ play sound (Bird v) until done
End
```
Once you have found a sequence that you are happy with and works for your project, add a `when green flag`{:class="block3events"} clicked `Event`{:class="block3events"} block to the top and your sequenced soundtrack will start when your project is run.

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
```

Or you may just want to use sounds that happen at a certain time, such as when a user interacts with a sprite or when sprites interact with each other.

Once you have your sounds, you may want to change some details such as setting the `volume`{:class="block3sound"}, the `pitch`{:class="block3sound"} or the balance, or `panning`{:class="block3sound"}, from left to right.

Changing the pitch of a sound also speeds it up. 

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
set [pitch v] effect to (speed)
```

Play the sound in a separate forever loop so that the pitch will change immediately rather than waiting until the sound is done: 

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
play sound [Dance Head Nod v] until done
```
