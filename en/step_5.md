## 3-Dimensional effects

In this step youâ€™re going to increase the 3-dimensional appearance by using the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks menu to enhance the sense of depth in your scene. You will use the `size`{:class="block3looks"} and `layers`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to make your sprites appear in front of or behind each other.

In the below example, the **Rocket** sprite which is in the distance is smaller than the **Taco Truck** and **Robot** sprites. The sprites are layered to appear to go in front of or behind each other.

Where relevant, resize your sprites. Some sprites can stay the same size.

</div>

Select the sprite that you want to resize and click on its **Code tab**. Add a `set size to %`{:class="block3looks"} block and change the value in the block to the percentage (%) size for that sprite.

Add a percentage value below `100` to decrease its size:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
+set size to (80)%
```

Add a percentage value above `100` to increase its size:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
+set size to (120)%
```

Now program your sprites into layers.

You can simply program your sprites into two layers using the `front layer`{:class="block3looks"} and `back layer`{:class="block3looks"} blocks. 

**Through the window**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/451497627/editor){:target="_blank"}

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/451497627/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

In the example, the **Window frame** sprite has a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block so it appears at the front. The **Avery Walking**, **Tree** and the **Sun** sprites each have `go to back layer`{:class="block3looks"} blocks so they appear at the back.


Select the sprite that you want at the front and click on its **Code tab**. Add a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
```

Select the sprite/s that you want at the back and click on its **Code tab**. Add a `go to back layer`{:class="block3looks"} block:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [back v] layer
```

title: Program your sprites in layers
---

Using the `go backward 1 layers`{:class="block3looks"} block you can place a sprite 1 layer behind the sprite at the front.

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
+go [backward v] (1) layers
```

Allocate layers to other sprites. Change the value in the `go backward`{:class="block3looks"}`1``layers`{:class="block3looks"} block depending on where you want each sprite to sit in relation to each other:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
+go [backward v] (2) layers
```

Animate your sprite by moving or changing its costumes.

--- collapse ---
---
title: Move your sprite

Get your sprite moving:

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
point in direction (90)
set rotation style [left-right v]
forever
move (5) steps
if on edge, bounce
```

title: Change your sprite's costume

Get your sprite changing costumes:

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever
next costume
wait (0.3) seconds
```
