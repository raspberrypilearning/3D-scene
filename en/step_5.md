## Movement within Layers 

Now, youâ€™re going to look at how to layer sprites to make some appear in front or behind others.

When you think about a stage or theatre in real life, you understand that the actors can move closer and further away from the audience; so that one can pass in front of another. You can use layers in your Scratch projects to create the same effect!

This project uses front and back layers to make the cats appear to circle the globe:

Think of the sprites in your project and decide how you can have them move in front of (or behind!) different parts of your project, like the scenery or other sprites. 

Consider how many layers you will have, and add blocks that will allow your sprites to change between the layers as above.

---
Think about layers as rows you can create to order your sprites from front to back and put them all in the right order. Once you know which sprites you would like to go on top, you can do this by having a sprite go to the front or back layer, and stepping into the right position through the layers.

To select your first sprite, click or tap on it under the Stage.

Click on the Code tab.

Use a `go to [back v] layer`{:class="block3looks"} or a `go to [front v] layer`{:class="block3looks"} block and either a `go [forward v] (1) layer`{:class="block3looks"} or a `go [backward v] (1) layer`{:class="block3looks"} block to create an order for your sprites and scenery.

You should get your sprite to go to the back (or front) layer and then move a number of layers at the start of your project:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [back v] layer
Go [forward v] (1)layers
```
Or:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
Go [backward v] (1)layers
```
