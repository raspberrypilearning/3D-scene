## 3-Dimensional effects

Now, youâ€™re going to use the `looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to program your sprites into 'layers'{:class="block3looks"} to make them appear in front or behind each other. You will also change the `size`{:class="block3looks"} of sprites in relation to each other.

Now, program your sprites into layers by programming them. You can keep it simple and just use the `front layer`{:class="block3looks"} and `back layer`{:class="block3looks"} if you like, or create multiple layers for more complex projects.

This project uses front and back layers to make the cats appear to circle the globe:

Think of the sprites in your project and decide how you can have them move in front of (or behind!) different parts of your project, like the scenery or other sprites. 

Consider how many layers you will have, and add blocks that will allow your sprites to change between the layers as above.

**Tip: Treat layers like rows:** Think about layers as rows you can create to order your sprites from front to back and put them all in the right order. 

Once you know which sprites you would like to go on top, you can do this by having a sprite `go to front`{:class="block3looks"} or `go to back`{:class="block3looks"} layer, and stepping into the right position through the layers.

Have a look at how this project orders each of the sprites from front to back by using `Go backward X layers`{:class="block3looks"} to create the feeling that the number 6 is 'at the back', while the number 1 is 'at the front':

To select your first sprite, click or tap on it under the Stage.

Click on the Code tab.

Use a `go to back layer`{:class="block3looks"} or a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block and either a `go forward 1 layer`{:class="block3looks"} or a `go backward 1 layer`{:class="block3looks"} block to create an order for your sprites and scenery.

You should get your sprite to go to the back (or front) layer and then move each sprite a concurrent number of layers at the start of your project:

Front sprite:
``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [back v] layer
Go [forward v] (1) layers
```

Rear sprite:
``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [back v] layer
Go [forward v] (2) layers
```

**Or:**

Front sprite:
``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
Go [backward v] (1) layers
```

Rear sprite:
``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
Go [backward v] (2) layers
```

Use the `change size by ()`{:class="block3looks"} or  `set size to ()%`{:class="block3looks"} block in your code to make your sprite shrink when it moves to the `back layer`{:class="block3looks"} and grow when it moves to the `front layer`{:class="block3looks"}!

Make your code change the size of your sprite when the layer changes by adding the `set size to ()%`{:class="block3looks"} like this:
``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
+set size to (120)%
```


``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [back v] layer
+set size to (80)%
```

You can also have the size of your sprite change every time it changes layer by using the `change size by ()`{:class="block3looks"} blocks:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [back v] layer
go [forward v] (1) layers
+change size by (20)
```

``` blocks3
when [down arrow v] key pressed
go to [front v] layer
go [back v] (1) layers
change size by (-20)
```
