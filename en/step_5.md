## 3D effects

In this step youâ€™re going to increase the 3-dimensional (3D) appearance by using the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks menu to enhance the sense of depth in your scene. You will use the `size`{:class="block3looks"} and `layers`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to make your sprites appear in front of or behind each other.

In the below example, the **Rocket** sprite which is in the distance is smaller than the **Taco Truck** and **Robot** sprites. The sprites are layered to appear to go in front of or behind each other.

Resize sprites to get the effect you want. Some sprites can stay the same size.

</div>

Select the sprite that you want to resize and click on its **Code** tab. Add a `set size to %`{:class="block3looks"} block and change the value in the block to the percentage (%) size for that sprite.

Add a percentage value below `100` to decrease its size:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
+set size to (80)%
```

Add a percentage value above `100` to increase its size:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
+set size to (120)%
```

When you add a new sprite it goes to the front layer. When you drag a sprite on the Stage it jumps to the front.

To make sure your sprites go to the correct layer you can program them. 

A simple approach is to send some sprites to the front and some to the back:

**Through the window two layers**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/451497627/editor){:target="_blank"}

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/451497627/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

In the example, the **Window frame** sprite has a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block so it appears at the front. The **Avery Walking** sprite has a `go to back layer`{:class="block3looks"} block to appear behind the **Window frame** sprite.

Select the sprite that you want at the front and click on its **Code** tab. Add a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
```

Select the sprite/s that you want at the back and click on its **Code** tab. Add a `go to back layer`{:class="block3looks"} block:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [back v] layer
```

When you have lots of overlapping sprites you can program your sprites into more layers:

**Through the window many layers**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/454188775/editor){:target="_blank"}

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/454188775/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

In the example, the **Window frame** sprite has a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block so it appears at the front and the **Sun** sprite has a `go to back layer`{:class="block3looks"} block so it appears at the back. The **Avery Walking** and **Tree** sprites each have a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block then a `go backward`{:class="block3looks"}`1``layers`{:class="block3looks"} block with different values for each sprite to place them each in their own layer.

Using the `go backward`{:class="block3looks"}`1``layers`{:class="block3looks"} block you can place a sprite 1 layer behind the sprite at the front.

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
+go [backward v] (1) layers
```

Allocate layers to other sprites. Change the value in the `go backward`{:class="block3looks"}`1``layers`{:class="block3looks"} block depending on where you want each sprite to sit in relation to each other:

``` blocks3
when green flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
+go [backward v] (2) layers
```

Animate your sprite by moving or changing its costumes.

--- collapse ---

title: Move your sprite

Get your sprite moving:

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
point in direction (90)
set rotation style [left-right v]
forever
move (5) steps
if on edge, bounce
```

For more information on motion, explore [Animate using motion](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/interactive-animation/3){:target="_blank"} in Challenge 1 Interactive animation.

title: Change your sprite's costume

Get your sprite changing costumes:

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever
next costume
wait (0.3) seconds
```

Click on the **Full Screen Control** icon above the Stage. Your project will fill your screen so you and others can interact with it more easily. In this mode, the sprites and sliders cannot be accidentally dragged in to a new position.

![Enter full screen](images/enter-full-screen.png)

Run your project. When you have finished, click the **Full Screen Control** icon to minimise the project and go back to the editor.
