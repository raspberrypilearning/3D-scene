## What next?

In this project, you have learned how to:

+ Explore the potential of Scratch to create a 3-dimensional scene
+ Create an interactive and engaging project
+ Improve your project using feedback from others

If you are following the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"} pathway and have not completed the last three projects — Fruit salad, Relax and stretch, and Focus on the prize — then now continue the pathway with [Fruit salad](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/fruit-salad){:target="_blank"}.

If you have completed all the projects in the Look after yourself pathway, then move on to the next environmentally-themed pathway, [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/protect-our-planet){:target="_blank"}. In this pathway, you will harness the power of computing to explore our planet whilst being introduced to procedures and clones.
