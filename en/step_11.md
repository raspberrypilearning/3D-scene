## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ How to explore the potential of Scratch to create a 3-dimensional scene
+ How to create an interactive and engaging project
+ How to improve your project using feedback from others

If you are following the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/look-after-yourself) pathway and have not completed the last three projects — Fruit salad, Relax and stretch, and Focus on the prize — then now continue the pathway with [Fruit salad](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/fruit-salad).

If you have completed all the projects in the Look after yourself pathway, then move on to the next environmentally-themed pathway, [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/protect-our-planet). In this pathway, you will harness the power of computing to explore our planet whilst being introduced to procedures and clones.
