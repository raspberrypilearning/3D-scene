Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.

If you have a Scratch account, and have shared your interactive animation project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments that are unhelpful or irrelevant.
