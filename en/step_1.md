## Introduction
You'll create a 3D scene that can be controlled with variables. The user will be able to act as the 'director' of the scene and play around until they get it just the way they want it. 

Your scene doesn't have to be sensible. You should try and make it fun for you and others to play around with. 

## What you will make
You will create a scene that uses a `layers`{:class="block3looks"}, `size`{:class="block3looks"}, `sound`{:class="block3sound"} and `motion`{:class="block3motion"} to create a 3D effect. You will add `variables`{:class="block3variables"} with sliders to control features of your scene so that the user can play around and customize the scene. 

You will see some examples and then plan your own scene. You will apply your coding and graphic skills to make a unique 3D scene of your own.

title: Skills you should have

Before starting this project, we recommend you complete the the first three projects in the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"} pathway: 
+ [Stress ball](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/stress-ball){:target="_blank"}
+ [Butterfly garden](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/butterfly-garden){:target="_blank"}
+ [Serene Scene](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/serene-scene){:target="_blank"}

For this project, you need to know how to:  

<mark>How many of the skills from the previous challenge should we keep here?</mark>
+ Add code to sprites and a backdrop
+ Use the tools in the Paint editor to add details to a sprite
+ Add `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"} and `sound`{:class="block3sound"} to a sprite
+ Use `Motion`{:class="block3motion"} blocks to create animation
+ Use costumes to customise sprites
+ Use the `forever`{:class="block3control"} block
+ Use the `next costume`{:class="block3control"} and `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks to animate a sprite


+ Make a `variable`{:class="block3control"}, turn it into a slider with a range and use it as an input to a block
+ Use `layers`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to move Sprites in front or behind other Sprites
+ Use `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks to add a delay 
+ Use simple `operators`{:class="block3operators"} to do calculations
