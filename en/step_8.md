Now youâ€™ve got your project working the way you want it to, you could add more layers to your 3D scenery.

If you only used backdrops and sprites from the Scratch gallery, then you could use the Paint editor to create some of your own scenery. 

You could also add more sound effects and variables.

**Tip**: Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.

You may want to investigate the example projects in **step 2: Get inspiration**.

Take a look at the community created 3D scene projects below OR explore the Raspberry Pi Foundations studio of **3D Scene Community Projects**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/28115978){:target="_blank"}
