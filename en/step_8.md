If you have time left you can add more layers to your scene.

If you only used backdrops and sprites that are included in Scratch then you should try and use the paint editor to create your own scenery.

In this space scene you can adjust the view of the planet that you see from inside your spaceship. Change the zoom slider to change the size of the planet to make it seem closer or further away and change the colour slide to change the colour effect.

You can use one of these examples to get started:

**Penguin slide**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/445030302/editor){:target="_blank"}

</div>

Use a variable called `time`{:class="block3data"} to control how many seconds it takes for a sprite to glide `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop runs. Setting the speed to a smaller number will make the sprite move faster.
