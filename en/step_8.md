## Add more ...

--- task ---
If you have time left you can add more layers to your scene.

If you only used backdrops and sprites that are included in Scratch then you should try and use the paint editor to create your own scenery. 

You can also add more sound effects and variables.

This example uses multiple layers and has a scenery sprite moving slowly to create a 3D effect. The music gets higher and faster as the dinosaur moves faster:
