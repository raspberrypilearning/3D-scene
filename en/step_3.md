## Choose a theme

In this step you will choose a theme.

--- task ---

In the example below, see how the **Moon** is able to rise from behind the silhouetted roofs because **Rooftops** is a sprite rather than being drawn on the backdrop.

+ Backdrop is **always** at the back and cannot move
+ Sprites can move around the screen, and be infront of or behind other sprites

Decide on the theme for your project. 

Think about:
+ What mood do you want to create? Will it be relaxing, energising, or funny?
+ What will your scenery look like?
+ What objects and characters will you include?
+ What will the user be able to control?

You don't have to decide all the details yet.

Give your project a name that matches your theme. Remember to use a **How to…** when you need help.

Click in the project name box and change the name to match your project.

If you share your project, then others will also see this name, so make sure it makes sense.
