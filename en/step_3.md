## Choose your theme

Now it's time to work on your own project.

--- task ---

+ Take five minutes to think about **your** '3D scene' project. 
+ What mood do you want to create? Will it be relaxing, energising, or funny?

+ What will your scenery look like? 

Imagine a stage in the theatre. Scenery tends to be made up of anything which in real-life does not move such as a mountainscape with pine trees, a street with houses, a forest with flowers, the moon with rocks, or a bedroom wall with furniture - whatever suits your project best. 

Things which are further away from the audience are smaller and lighter in colour. This creates a greater sense of depth and helps to make things more realistic.

Look at the examples below:

Objects which are already drawn onto a backdrop cannot be programmed.

Objects that are drawn on a backdrop are not sprites, they cannot be layered or programmed and therefore cannot be animated. In the below example, the wooden chair drawn is drawn onto the backdrop and cannot be programmed but the **Wheelchair** sprite can.

Open a [new Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor){:target=”_blank”}.

Think about what backdrop and sprites will you choose and/or create for your scenery. In this project, for your scenery, you can **Choose a Backdrop** or make one. For other objects in your scene you can either **Choose a Sprite** or make them. The choice is yours.
