## Choose your theme

Now it's time to work on your own project. You may be bursting with ideas already, or you may need to take a few minutes to decide on a theme you want to work with. 

When you think about a stage or theatre in real life, you understand that the actors can move closer or further away from the audience; so that one can pass in front of another. This is called **depth**, and it makes things feel more realistic when you watch them (even cartoons!)

This will help to create a greater sense of depth in your scene. Bigger sprites appear to be closer to the front of the stage with smaller sprites appearing further away.

Open a [new Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor){:target=”_blank”}. Take five minutes to think about **your** '3D scene' project. 

+ What mood do you want to create? Will it be relaxing, energising, or funny?

In this project you will choose or design your own a backdrop. You will also create a number of sprites

Below are some examples of **How to…**. You can use these if you need a reminder, or to understand blocks in more detail.

Add a backdrop of your choice. Don't worry too much as you can change it at any time as you develop your idea. 

Objects which are already drawn onto a backdrop cannot be programmed. Choose a simple backdrop with just a few or no objects drawn on it. This will give you more freedom as you go on to create sprites as part of your scenery in the next step.

If you share your project, then others will also see this name, so make sure it makes sense.
