## Choose a theme

In this step you will choose a theme for your 3D scene.

In the example below, see how the **Moon** is able to rise from behind the silhouetted roofs because **Rooftops** is a sprite rather than being drawn on the backdrop.

+ A Backdrop is **always** at the back and cannot move
+ Sprites can move around the stage, and be in front of or behind other sprites

To decide on the theme for your project try and answer the following questions. You don't have to decide all of the details yet:
+ What mood do you want to create? Will it be relaxing, energising, or funny?
+ What will your scenery look like?
+ What objects and characters will you include in your scene?
+ What will the user be able to control with sliders?

Give your project a name that matches your theme and save it. Remember to use a **How toâ€¦** when you need help.

Save your project so far. Go to **File** in the menu. If you have a Scratch account, click on **Save now**. If you do not have an account, click on **Save to your computer**.

Click in the project name box and change the name to match your project.

If you share your project, then others will also see this name, so make sure it makes sense.
