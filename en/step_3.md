## 3-dimensions

In this step you will think about 3-dimensional scenery.

Imagine a stage in the theatre. Scenery tends to be made up of anything which in real-life does not move. For example, a mountainscape with pine trees, a street with houses, a forest with flowers, the moon with rocks, or a bedroom wall with furniture - whatever suits your project best. 

Look at the examples below. Each project is made up of a backdrop and a number of sprites to create a 3D scene:

Objects which are already drawn onto a backdrop are not sprites so they cannot be layered or programmed and therefore cannot be animated. In the below example, the wooden chair is drawn onto the backdrop and cannot be programmed but the **Wheelchair** sprite can:

As in the theatre, characters move through the scenery.

Things which appear behind other objects or characters (layers) and are smaller and lighter in colour look further away from the audience/user. These are useful 3-dimensional effects which can be used to create a greater sense of depth. They help to make your project appear more realistic.
